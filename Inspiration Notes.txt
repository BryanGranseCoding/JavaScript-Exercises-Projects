Just two words: “do projects”

You’ll spend ages on the project as a beginner. This will naturally lead you to re-read the concepts again and again fixing your errors, troubleshooting, and not only trying to understand but also how to use what you understood and BEHOLD by the time you finish the project:
1- you feel great sense of accomplishment
2- you’ll have practical experience
3- you’ll have a project for your portfolio.
4- subconsciously you’ll know how to apply what you have learnt - you’ll be more intuitive.
5- you won’t have to memorise anything, doing is the best process of memorising.
6- if you need a revision, you’ll just review your project instead of re watching hours and hours of videos and get stuck in Tutorial hell.
7- Reduces imposter syndrome later on
